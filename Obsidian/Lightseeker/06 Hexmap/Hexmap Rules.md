Each hex = 6 miles from the center to the edge.
1 Day = 6 Watches
1 Watch = 4 Hours
Watch Types = Active, Rest, Travel

While traveling, it is assumed that an expedition is spending two watches per day traveling, two watches per day resting, and two watches per day engaged in other activities.

##### Travel

**Forced March.** If spending more than two watches traveling in one day, make CON check (DC 10 + 1 per hour of additional travel). On a failure, they suffer one level of exhaustion.

**Travel Pace** (per watch)
- **Exploration Pace.** 0.5 Hex. Cannot use Stealth checks to avoid detection. Adv on Navigation checks. Chance for encounters is doubled.
- **Slow Pace.**  0.75 Hex. Adv on Navigation checks. Can make Stealth checks. Chance of non-exploratory encounter is halved.
- **Normal Pace.** 1 Hex. Cannot use Stealth checks to avoid detection.
- **Fast Pace.** 1.5 Hex. Cannot use Stealth checks to avoid detection. Disadv on Wisdom (Perception) checks. -5 penalty to Navigation checks.

**Mounts.** Double distance traveled.
**Vehicles.** Depending on the road, double or triple the distance traveled.

##### Watch Actions
There are several watch actions:
###### 1. Forager
Active watch or while traveling at a slow pace.
Wisdom (Survival) check against Forage DC of the terrain.
- On a success, gain 1 ration of food or find a source of fresh water. For every 2 points above the DC, gain additional ration or water.
**Food.** Small or Medium creatures require 1 ration of food per day.
- They can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON (minimum 1) before suffering 1 exhaustion level per day.
- A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.
**Water.** Small or Medium creatures require 1 gallon of water per day, or twice in hot weather.
- A creature on half ration of water must succeed on a DC 15 Con check or suffer a level of exhaustion.
- If they drink less water than that, they suffer a level of exhaustion automatically.
- If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels instead of one level in either case.
- Waterskins hold a half-ration of water.
**Recovery.** Any exhaustion suffered from lack of food or water cannot be removed until after a full day of normal consumption.
**Large & Tiny Creatures.** Tiny creatures require one-quarter ration of food and water per day. Large creatures require four rations of food and water per day.

###### 2. Navigator
- The expedition’s navigator is responsible for making navigation checks.
- A second navigator can assist, granting advantage to the navigation checks.

- **Using Landmarks.** Generally speaking, it’s trivial to follow a road, river, or other natural feature of the terrain.
	- It’s similarly easy to head towards any visible landmark.
	- The landmark or terrain feature will determine the route of travel and there’s no chance of becoming lost, so you can simply track the number of miles traveled.

- **Identifying Landmarks.** If the PCs are unsure of a landmark but have had previous experience with it, it may be possible to identify it with a Wisdom (Survival) check, at the DM’s discretion. 
	- The accuracy and detail of the identification will depend on prior experience.
	- Example: *A ranger is passing through the woods when they encounter a river. If it’s a river they’ve walked up and down before, the Wisdom (Survival) check might let them confirm that it is, in fact, the Mirthwindle. If they’re less familiar with the region, the check might tell them that this is probably the same river they crossed earlier in the day – it must be taking a southerly bend. If this is the first time they’ve ever seen this river in an area they’re not familiar with, the Wisdom (Survival) check won’t tell them much more than “this is a river.”*

- **Specific Direction.** Characters trying to move in a specific direction through the wilderness must make a navigation check using their Wisdom (Survival) skill once per watch to avoid becoming lost.
	- The DC of the check is primarily determined by the terrain type the expedition is moving through, although other factors may also apply.

- **Getting Lost.** Characters who fail the navigation check become lost and may veer away from their intended direction of travel, as indicated by a 1d10 roll on the diagram below.
	- When lost characters exit a hex, they will exit through the face of the hex indicated by the die roll.
![[Pasted image 20240404080850.png]]

- Characters who are lost remain lost. In the new hex neither their intended direction of travel nor their veer will change.
- If characters who are already lost fail another navigation check, their veer can increase but not decrease.

- **Recognizing You're Lost.** Lost navigators continue making a navigation check once per watch.
	- If the check succeeds, they will recognize that they are no longer certain of their direction of travel.
	- Navigators who encounter a clear landmark or unexpectedly enter a distinctly new type of terrain can make an additional navigation check to realize that they’ve become lost.

- **Finding Locations.**
	- **Visible Locations.** Characters within the same hex as the visible location (or within a certain number of hexes, as indicated by the key) automatically spot a visible location.
	- **On Road.** If a location is on a road, river, or trail, then a character following the road, river, or trail will automatically find the location. (Assuming it isn’t hidden, of course.)
	- **Familiar Locations.** Familiar locations are those which a navigator has visited multiple times.
		- Navigators within the same hex as a familiar location can be assumed to automatically find the location. 
		- Under certain circumstances, navigators may also be considered “familiar” with a location even if they’ve never been there. (Possibilities include possessing highly accurate topographic maps, receiving divine visions, or using certain types of divinatory magic.)
	- **Unfamiliar Locations.** Unfamiliar locations (even those a navigator has been to previously) are found using encounter checks.

###### 3. Pack-Puller
- A pack-puller is responsible for managing an expeditions pack animals.
- A pack-puller can lead a number of animals equal to their passive Wisdom (Animal Handling) score. (This number includes the pack-puller’s mount, if any.)
###### 4. Resting
- A character must take the Resting watch action for two rest watches in a row in order to gain the benefits of a Long Rest. (See the rules for Long Rests regarding which types of interruptions are possible without disrupting the Resting action.)
- **Lack of Sleep.** If a character does not spend at least one full watch per day resting, they must succeed at a Constitution saving throw (DC 16 – the number of hours they slept, if any) or suffer a level of exhaustion.
###### 5. Scout
A scout can journey out from an expedition in an effort to chart a course or learn the lay of the land. When scouting, they can choose one of two actions:
- **Reporting.** If the navigator receives a scout’s report, they gain advantage on their navigation checks for the next travel watch.
- **Pathfinding.** The scout attempts a Wisdom (Survival) score using the area’s Navigation DC. On a success, the expedition can treat trackless terrain as if it had a trail for one watch.

A character can scout during a watch in which an expedition is traveling only if their speed is faster than the expedition’s. Alternatively, scouts can be sent out during watches in which the rest of the expedition are active or resting (but not traveling).
- **Encounter Check.** An additional encounter check is made for each scouting group. (They are effectively a separate expedition while engaged in scouting.)
###### 6. Sentinel
- A member of an expedition acting as a sentinel can make Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect threats or notice anything else out of the ordinary.
- **Outrider.** During a travel watch, a character can journey out in an effort to protect the expedition from detection or threats.
	- Whenever an encounter is generated for the expedition, each outrider group can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 15 or opposed by the encounter’s Stealth check) to detect the encounter before it’s encountered by the expedition.
- **Encounter Check.** However, an additional encounter check is also made for each outrider group at one-half the normal chance of an encounter. (It’s possible for outriders to discover locations or encounter creatures which would have otherwise been missed by the main expedition.)
###### 7. Sighting
- During an active watch, a character can take a watch action to find an outlook – a good sighting place which will allow the character to significantly extend the distance to which they can see the surrounding wilderness.
- At the GM’s discretion, a skill check may be required to identify or reach the outlook. (For example, a Strength (Athletics) check to reach the top of an appropriately positioned tree.)
- As a general rule of thumb, assume that characters can find a location granting them 50 feet of height (or the equivalent thereof).
- This will allow them to see into neighboring hexes, and possibly even see notable locations within those hexes or their current hex (which may or may not require a Wisdom (Perception) check).
- If you call for a skill check to find a sighting location, consider using a fail forward technique:
	- On a success, the PCs get the normal benefits of sighting.
	- On a failure, they might only be able to make out the terrain type of two or three of the nearby hexes (and no details thereof).
###### 8. Tracker
- **Finding Tracks.** Searching a significant wilderness area for tracks is an active watch action.
	- The tracker makes a Wisdom (Perception) check against the appropriate Track DC.

- **Following Tracks.** Once tracks have been found, a tracker can follow the trail during a travel watch by making a Wisdom (Survival) check against the appropriate Track DC.
	- A new check must be made each time the trail enter a new hex.

- **Lost Trail.** If a trail is lost, it may be possible to reacquire it using the Finding Tracks action.

- **Cover Your Tracks.** As a watch action, a character can attempt to cover the expedition’s tracks. 
	- This is a stealth action, requiring the expedition to be moving at a slow pace.
	- The character makes a Wisdom (Stealth) or Wisdom (Survival) check to set the Track DC for any pursuer attempting to find or follow their tracks.
	- The check suffers disadvantage in very soft ground, but gains advantage on hard ground.
	- Condition modifiers apply normally to the pursuer’s tracking check.

| Surface                                               | Track DC |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Very soft ground (snow, wet mud)                      | 5        |
| Soft ground (sand)                                    | 10       |
| Firm ground (fields, woods, thick rugs, dusty floors) | 15       |
| Hard ground (bare rock, indoor floor, streambeds)     | 20       |

| Condition                                   | Modifier    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Multiple people                             | -2          |
| Large group                                 | -4          |
| Very large group                            | -8          |
| Creature is bleeding                        | -4          |
| Every day since the trail was made          | +1 per day  |
| Every hour of rain since the trail was made | +1 per hour |
| Fresh snow cover since the trail was made   | +10         |

###### 9. Trailblazer
- Trailblazing is a special travel pace which can be taken in conjunction with other travel paces.
- It marks an efficient trail through the wilderness with some form of signs – paint, simple carvings, cloth flags, etc.
- Once blazed, this is considered a known trail to the expedition.

- **Hidden Signs.** The signs of a trail can be followed by any creature. 
	- When blazing a trail, however, the character making the signs can make a Wisdom (Stealth) check to disguise them so that they can only be noticed or found with a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check.
	- If hidden signs are being employed, an additional character can assist the trailblazer on their Wisdom (Stealth) check.
	- You don’t need to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to follow your own hidden signs (or the hidden signs of a known trail you’ve followed before).
	- Those who are aware of the trail’s existence but who have not followed it before gain advantage on their Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find the trail sign.
		- Trail signs – including hidden trail signs – may be encountered as an exploration encounter in a hex the trail passes through.




##### Full Hexcrawl Procedure
###### 1. DIRECTION & TRAVEL PACE.
Determine the expedition’s navigator.
Navigator determines intended direction and travel pace.
###### 2. ENCOUNTER CHECK. Use the dice at the top of this page.
- If in a border hex, check to see which encounter table should be used.
###### 3. WATCH ACTIONS. Resolve all watch actions.
###### 4. ARE THEY LOST?

If they are not following a landmark or trail, make a Navigation check.
If they are lost, determine veer. If they are already lost, veer can be increased but not decreased.
5. HEX PROGRESS

It takes 12 miles of progress to exit one of the hex’s 3 far faces.
It takes 6 miles of progress to exit one of the hex’s 2 near faces.
Changing direction within a hex will result in the loss of 2 miles of progress.
If characters double back, reduce progress until they exit the hex. If they leave the hex by any other route, it requires an additional 1d6-1 miles of progress to exit the hex.
LEAVING A HEX:

Determine new hex (by applying current veer to the expedition’s direction of travel).
If they were lost, make a Navigation check to see if they recognize it. If they do, they can attempt to reorient. If they do not, veer accumulates. (Note: Using a compass automatically resets veer at the hex border even if they don’t recognize they were off course.)
