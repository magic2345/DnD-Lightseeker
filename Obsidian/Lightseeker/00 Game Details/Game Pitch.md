**“Live. Survive. Escape the mist. Find the truth. Seek the light.”**

### The Setting's Six Truths
1. Strange mist has covered the kingdom for the last 80 years, blocking out most of the sun.
2. The land is blighted, the waters poisoned. It is rare to find safe food and drink.
3. Living beings mutate and adapt to the surroundings, creating terrifying ghastly horrors.
4. Any semblance of civilization is few and far between.
5. Only the church is able to somewhat purify the contaminants. Even then, not many are gifted in the divine.
6. Insanity is rampant within the people. Hold yourself back and control it, lest it control you.

### Main Conflicts and Themes
- Loss of humanity.
- Mutation and corruption.
- Survival and horror.
- Sins of the past.
- Trust and control.
- Finding hope in the depths of despair.

### Who are you?
Whoever you are in the past, several things are true now.
- You are on your last legs. You have nowhere else to go. Circumstances have forced you to become Hunters, those who embrace corruption to go out into the wilderness and hunt. Hunters are respected, feared, and ostracized.
- Yet, who were you before becoming a hunter? Did you live a decent life or were you starving on the streets since you could remember? How did your life crumble? Are there any pieces left?
- You have been given an offer to become a hunter by Andurin Cragscliff, an old veteran hunter. The grey-haired dwarf styles himself as a historian of sorts, trying to find out the origins of the mist. What is your relationship with him? How did he find you?


### Setting Notes
1. Rations are separated into safe and non-safe rations.

2. 



### Homebrew Houserules
1. Gritty Rest
   - Short Rest require at least **30 minutes**.
	   - During the rest, PCs may spend any number of hit dice to regain hit points.
	   - If a fire was made and each PC slept for at least 6 hours, they may each roll a d6. On a 6, that PC regains hit points equal to 1+CON mod.
     
   - Long Rest require at least **8 hours** in a safe place designated by the GM, typically lodging at a tavern.
	   - Camping in the wilderness or off the side of the road is not sufficient.
	   - At least 6 of those hours must be spent sleeping.
	   - After the rest, the PCs regain hit points equal to their **max Hit Die + CON**.
	   - They regain a number of Hit Dice equal to their proficiency bonus.
	   - They may spend any number of hit dice to recover additional hit points.

| Lodging Quality | Cost/PC | Benefit                                          |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |

| Exquisite       | -       | Long Rest + Regain All Hit Dice & All Hit Points |

| d20   | Lodging Complications                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | You become cursed by a “Shadow”. You don’t recover any hit dice during this long rest and won’t recover any until the “Shadow” that stalks you is slain.                  |
| 2-3   | You contract a random disease. Consult the Disease table to learn your misfortune.                                                                                        |
| 4-5   | Your coin purse was snatched in the middle of the night. You lose all your coin.                                                                                          |
| 6-7   | You wake to find town guards/militia at your door. You have been falsely accused of a crime you didn’t commit and are ordered to serve your sentence.                     |
| 8-9   | Somebody pulled a fast one and you notice your coin purse feels lighter than it should. You lose half your total coin.                                                    |
| 10-11 | Your rest is plagued by severe nightmares. You recover only half your proficiency bonus worth of hit dice for this rest.                                                  |
| 12-13 | You were bit by something in the night. You must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or be poisoned for the next 24 hours.                                                        |
| 14-15 | Awful rumors have been spread amongst the local population. Folks have a negative and untrusting disposition towards you and any who might affiliate themselves with you. |
| 16-18 | Several pests got into your food supply. You lose 1d6 rations.                                                                                                            |
| 19-20 | Thugs, thieves, spies or enemies report on your whereabouts.                                                                                                              |

2. Critical Fail (Fumble) Table
   When attacking, if the result of the roll is a 1, roll on the table below for an extra effect.

| d20   | Critical Fumble Result                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | **Dangerously exposed.** The target of your attack can use its reaction to either make a single melee attack against you with advantage, or move half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. |
| 2-3   | **Lost grip.** Your currently equipped weapon flies from your hand in a random direction, landing 15 feet away from you.                                                                               |
| 4-5   | **Clumsy footwork.** Your speed is reduced to zero until the start of your next turn. If you’ve already moved this turn, you fall prone.                                                               |
| 6-7   | **Resounding deflection.** You have disadvantage on your next attack roll.                                                                                                                             |
| 8-9   | **Disrupted focus.** You can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                       |
| 10-11 | **Caught off-guard.** The next attack roll made against you gains advantage.                                                                                                                           |
| 12-17 | **Poor aim.** The attack misses with no additional effect.                                                                                                                                             |
| 18-19 | **Transferred momentum.** The attack misses, but you gain advantage on your next attack roll.                                                                                                          |
| 20    | **Remarkable reversal.** Instead of a miss, the attack hits instead.                                                                                                                                   |

3. Warped Weave
   Casting spells does not cost spell slots. Instead, they require a successful spellcasting check, one free hand, and any required material components or arcane focus.
   - The level of spells you can cast depends on your class table in the PHB.
   - If your roll does not meet or beat the DC, the spell fails and it cannot be cast again until you complete a long rest.
   - The spellcasting check is:
     d20 + Prof + Spellcasting Mod
     DC = 10 + Spell Level
   - To cast at higher level, simply increase the DC.
   - Rituals can be cast without a spellcasting check.
   - Cantrips can be cast without a spellcasting check. Yet, it also does not become more powerful following the PC's level.
   - Critical Success on the spellcasting check means that the player may choose between: **Double Dice Damage, Double Targets, Double Duration, Recover One Failed Spells.**
   - Critical Fail on the spellcasting check different repercussions depending on the class.
	- Pay Tribute (Cleric, Druids, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Bard)
	   You have angered your deity, offset the balance of nature, or displeased the muses of old. You must pay tribute to regain the ability to cast that spell again.
	   To pay tribute, bring an offering to a place deemed relevant to the source of your magic. For clerics, that might be a temple or shrine to your deity. For druids, that might be a particular grove in the woods or body of water. For bards, that may be a donation to a town crier or raising money for an orphanage by leveraging your art form.

| Spell Level | GP/Item Tribute Value |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| 1st         | 5 gp                  |
| 2nd         | 25 gp                 |
| 3rd         | 50 gp                 |
| 4th         | 75 gp                 |
| 5th         | 100 gp                |
| 6th         | 200 gp                |
| 7th         | 300 gp                |
| 8th         | 400 gp                |
| 9th         | 500 gp                |
	- Arcane Mishap (Fighter, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
	  If you roll a Natural 1 on your spellcasting check, even with the use of blood magic to succeed, you trigger an arcane mishap. Roll a D20 and consult the spellcasting mishap table below.

| Roll  | Arcane Mishap Result                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3   | Gain 1 level of exhaustion. The caster and all creatures within 30ft take 2d6<br>damage/spell level and suffer the effects of the spell. |
| 4-7   | Gain 1 level of exhaustion. Caster takes 2d6 damage/spell level.                                                                         |
| 8-15  | Gain 1 level of exhaustion. Caster takes 1d6 damage/spell level.                                                                         |
| 16-19 | Caster takes 1d4 damage/spell level.                                                                                                     |
| 20    | As luck would have it, you are unharmed.                                                                                                 |
- Blood Magic
  Anytime a PC fails a spellcasting check, they may force the spell to succeed by fueling it with their own blood. To do this, the PC takes 1 blood magic damage for each point needed to allow the spell to be cast successfully. Blood magic can even force a spellcasting check of a natural 1 to succeed.
  A spell cast with blood magic cannot be cast again until you complete a long rest.
- Resurrection Magic
  Any magic that brings a PC back to life.
	- Material components are required.
	- If successfully cast, the target awakens with 1 hit point and can only recover hit points by resting. This effect ends once they reach their maximum hit points.
	- It is absolutely FORBIDDEN to use Blood Magic to cast a Resurrection spell. Or else...
- Paladin's Divine Smite
  Make a spellcasting check according to the what level the slot used is. If the paladin fails, they lose the ability to smite until they finish a long rest.
- Wizard's Arcane Recovery
  Allows the user to regain 1d4 lost spells.
- Sorcerer's Font of Magic
	- Able to spend 5 sorcery points to regain a single lost spell.
	- Able to use sorcery points during blood magic.
	- New Metamagic Option:
	  Focused Spell. When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to enhance your focus on the casting. If the spellcasting check fails, you do not lose the spell for that casting unless you rolled a natural 1.
- Warlock's Spell Slots
  Warlocks regain their failed spells on a short rest.
- Spell Attacks
  Treat the spellcasting check as the attack roll.
- Spell Saves
  Enemy still rolls a save.
  

4. Sturdy Physique
   Due to embracing the corruption, your bodies are physically fit. When counting HP during a level up, do not take average or roll. Your HP goes up by:
	   MaxNumberOnHitDie + CON Mod

5. Alternative Exhaustion Rules
   Instead of the normal exhaustion rules, Players get a -1 penalty to any ability checks, saving throws, and attacks per 1 stack of exhaustion. They also get the same penalty to their Spell Save DC.
   When a player's penalty goes over -10, they die. They're not unconscious, they straight up die.

6. Critical Damage Calculation
   Crits are calculated as follows:
   ```MaxNumberOnDice + Roll Dice + Modifiers```
   Example:
   A weapon attack with 2d6 damage will deal
   ```12 + 2d6 + Mod``` damage.
   A guiding bolt spell with 4d6 damage will deal ```24 + 4d6``` damage.

7. Madness Score
   Other than the 6 ability scores, each player has a Madness Score which starts out at 0 and has a max of 10.
   - Each time the player willingly and knowingly does something inhumane (such as killing an innocent), witness a horrifying event, or become the target of a madness-inducing effect, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.
   - The DC is equal to 10 + Madness Score.
   - On a success, nothing happens as the player manages to resist the madness.
   - On a failure, the player must roll on the Madness table (Short-Term table for Madness Score of 0-5 and Long-Term table for Madness Score of 6-10) The player's Madness Score also increases by 1. 
   - If a player's Madness Score would go over 10, they succumb the corruption and become a mindless monster driven by madness.

8. Healing Potions
   - Using an Action to drink a healing potion in battle heals you the full amount, no rolls are needed. This also goes for using it on an ally.
   - Using a Bonus Action still needs a roll.

9. Intelligent Characters
   - A positive Int modifier allows you to choose more languages, tool proficiencies, instrument proficiencies, or vehicle proficiencies.

10. Flanking Bonuses
   - Flanking gives +2 to attack rolls.
   - Only creatures within 5 ft can flank.

11. Armorer's Handbook (by Heavyarms)
   - This overhauls equipment from the PHB. It allows the players to spend money to upgrade them.
   - This includes various types of arrows and their usage.

12. Talents (by Dragonix)
   - Talents are similar to feats. More info during Session 0.

13. Monster Carving/Loot (by Drifters Game Workshop)
   - Adds mechanics to appraise and harvest monsters/enemies for loot. Some loot may be used as materials to craft magic items.
