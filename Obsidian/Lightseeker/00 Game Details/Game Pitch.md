**“Live. Survive. Escape the mist. Find the truth. Seek the light.”**

### The Setting's Six Truths
1. Strange mist has covered the kingdom of Vanblume for the last 80 years, blocking out most of the sun.
2. The land is blighted, the waters poisoned. It is rare to find safe food or drink.
3. Living beings mutate and adapt to the surroundings, often creating terrifying ghastly horrors.
4. Any semblance of civilization is few and far between.
5. Only the church is able to somewhat purify the contaminants. Even then, not many are gifted in the divine.
6. Insanity is rampant within the people. Hold yourself back and control it, lest it control you.

### Main Conflicts and Themes
- Loss of humanity.
- Mutation and corruption.
- Survival and horror.
- Sins of the past.
- Trust and control.
- Finding hope in the depths of despair.

### Who are you?
Whoever you are in the past, several things are true now.
- **Hanging on a Cliff.** You are on your last legs. You have nowhere else to go. Circumstances have forced you to become Hunters, those who embrace corruption to go out into the wilderness and hunt. Hunters are respected, feared, and ostracized.
- **Patron.** Andurin Cragscliff, an old veteran hunter, has inducted you into the fold. The grey-haired dwarf styles himself as a historian of sorts, searching for the mist's origins. What is your relationship with him? Who is he to you?
- **Dim Light.** You live in Maplemoor, a small town surrounded by forests. Who were you before becoming a hunter? Did you live a decent life or were you starving on the streets since you could remember? How did your life crumble? Are there any pieces left?
- **Flicker of the Past.** An event in your past has etched itself into your psyche. A trauma. What was the traumatic event? How did it help shape your worldview?
  Below are some ideas: 
	1. **Self-Blame**. The death or scarring of a loved one, which you believe to be your fault.
	2. **Isolation.** You were isolated and abandoned.
	3. **Dread**. Encountered a horrific creature outside of the village or learned a mind-shattering secret of the world.
	4. **Near-death**. Perhaps you've been trapped in a burning house or had almost drowned.
	5. **Betrayal**. Someone you've trusted has betrayed you and ruined your life.
	6. **Overwhelming Violence**. You have witnessed violence to its highest degree.
- **Hunter Aura.** Each hunter has a unique aura that differentiates themselves from others. What is yours? What sensory information does your aura contain? Normally, only hunters can detect each other's auras.
  Below are some ideas:
	  1. Smell of burnt skin.
	  2. Cracks at the edges of the vision.
	  3. Taste of moss.
	  4. Itchiness all over the body
	  5. Whispers from behind.
	  6. Heavy burden.
- **Band of Misfits.** You are a member of a newly-founded hunter clan. You don't know each other very well yet. Or... perhaps you do? A member has piqued your interest, for better or worse. Who is it and why?

### Setting Notes
##### Pertaining to Hunters
1. **Altered Body.** Hunters are those who have chosen to embrace corruption and drink a sinister concoction made of mutated ingredients. Their initial skills and experiences are obtained from others, not through their own efforts.
2. **Links of Blood.** Hunters are inducted in a group, their fates tied together as they form a clan. Members of a clan are able to resist corruption when they are close to each other. Some clans even develop powerful synergistic skills as they become more powerful.
3. **Dying Lone Wolf.** Hunters who are the last of their clan essentially lost a part of their souls. They become prone to madness and insanity. Following the hunter tradition, these hunters seek out others to continue the lineage, transferring their knowledge and mentoring a new clan.
4. **Crazed Monstrosities.** Hunters who have lost their minds to the corruption often become an empty husk. Yet, sometimes, they become monstrosities, sources of madness who aimlessly roam the lands. Due to this, those in the know would often kill off all members of a hunter clan, or leave at least two alive.
5. **People's Perception.** Some revere hunters as saviors. Others are wary of them and their power. There are also those that pity hunters and their fate.

##### Pertaining to the Town of Maplemoor
1. **Guildsmen.** Maplemoor is a town that is governed by a consortium of guildmasters. The food grown and livestock reared in the town has less contamination than usual. It is unclear why.
2. **Treated as Mercenaries.** Hunters in the town are treated as mercenaries that will do any job for coin. Individual perceptions may vary.
3. **Ambitious Leader.** Garadun, the dwarven leader of Maplemoor, has great ambitions for the town. He aims to attract many more people into the town and increase its size, thereby widening its influence.

##### Pertaining to the World
1. **Sources of Life.** Villages and towns form around sources of safe food and water.
2. **Safe Rations.** After eating safe rations during a period of light activity that lasts more than 6 hours (does not have to be a long rest), you gain 2d4+CON temporary hit points. These temporary hit points do not stack and only lasts for a day.
3. **Contamination.** Rations foraged from the wilderness are very likely contaminated. They do not grant any temporary hit points. A hunter's body is able to somewhat resist contamination.
	- If a non-hunter consumes contaminated rations, they must make a DC10 (+1 for each day consuming contaminated rations) CON saving throw, or take 2 stacks of exhaustion.
4. **Precious Knowledge.** The people's average level of knowledge is low. There are many that cannot read or write. Technology has regressed a few hundred years.
5. **Isolated Communities.** Most villages and towns are isolated from each other. Only those brave, powerful, or reckless enough are able to journey through the corrupted wilderness.

### Homebrew Houserules
#### 1. Gritty Rest (by House DM)
- **Short Rest** require at least **30 minutes**
	- During the rest, PCs may spend any number of hit dice to regain hit points.
	- If a fire was made and each PC slept for at least 6 hours, they may each roll a d6. On a 6, that PC regains hit points equal to 1+CON mod. 
- **Long Rest** require at least **8 hours** in a safe place designated by the GM, typically lodging at a tavern or at a base camp.
	- Camping in the wilderness or off the side of the road without a base camp is not sufficient.
	- At least 6 of those hours must be spent sleeping.
	- After the rest, the PCs regain hit points equal to their **max Hit Die + CON**.
	- They regain a number of Hit Dice equal to their proficiency bonus.
	- They may spend any number of hit dice to recover additional hit points.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | You become cursed by a “Shadow”. You don’t recover any hit dice during this long rest and won’t recover any until the “Shadow” that stalks you is slain.                  |
| 2-3   | You contract a random disease.                                                                                                                                            |
| 4-5   | Your coin purse was snatched in the middle of the night. You lose all your coin.                                                                                          |
| 6-7   | You wake to find town guards/militia at your door. You have been falsely accused of a crime you didn’t commit and are ordered to serve your sentence.                     |
| 8-9   | Somebody pulled a fast one and you notice your coin purse feels lighter than it should. You lose half your total coin.                                                    |
| 10-11 | Your rest is plagued by severe nightmares. You recover only half your proficiency bonus worth of hit dice for this rest.                                                  |
| 12-13 | You were bit by something in the night. You must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or be poisoned for the next 24 hours.                                                        |
| 14-15 | Awful rumors have been spread amongst the local population. Folks have a negative and untrusting disposition towards you and any who might affiliate themselves with you. |
| 16-18 | Several pests got into your food supply. You lose 1d6 rations.                                                                                                            |
| 19-20 | Thugs, thieves, spies or enemies report on your whereabouts.                                                                                                              |

#### 2. Critical Fail (Fumble) Table
- When attacking, if the result of the roll is a 1, roll on the table below for an extra effect.
##### Critical Fumble Table

| d20   | Critical Fumble Result                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | **Dangerously exposed.** The target of your attack can use its reaction to either make a single melee attack against you with advantage, or move half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. |
| 2-3   | **Lost grip.** Your currently equipped weapon flies from your hand in a random direction, landing 15 feet away from you.                                                                               |
| 4-5   | **Clumsy footwork.** Your speed is reduced to zero until the start of your next turn. If you’ve already moved this turn, you fall prone.                                                               |
| 6-7   | **Resounding deflection.** You have disadvantage on your next attack roll.                                                                                                                             |
| 8-9   | **Disrupted focus.** You can’t take reactions until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                       |
| 10-11 | **Caught off-guard.** The next attack roll made against you gains advantage.                                                                                                                           |
| 12-17 | **Poor aim.** The attack misses with no additional effect.                                                                                                                                             |
| 18-19 | **Transferred momentum.** The attack misses, but you gain advantage on your next attack roll.                                                                                                          |
| 20    | **Remarkable reversal.** Instead of a miss, the attack hits instead.                                                                                                                                   |

#### 3. Blood, Sweat, and Tears
- When rolling a d20 for attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, a player may spend their Hit Points to increase the result of the roll.
- Players cannot change a roll into a critical by doing this.
- Players cannot escape the effects of a critical 1 (fumble) by doing this.

#### 4. Sturdy Physique
- Due to embracing the corruption, your bodies are physically fit. When counting HP during a level up, do not take average or roll. Your HP goes up by:
	   MaxNumberOnHitDie + CON Mod

#### 5. Alternative Exhaustion Rules
   - Instead of the normal exhaustion rules, Players get a -1 penalty to any ability checks, saving throws, and attacks per 1 stack of exhaustion. They also get the same penalty to their Spell Save DC.
   - When a player's penalty goes over -10, they die. They're not unconscious, they straight up die.
   - Long Rest removes 1 stack of exhaustion.

#### 6. Critical Damage Calculation
   Crits are calculated as follows:
   ```MaxNumberOnDice + Roll Dice + Modifiers```
   Example:
   A weapon attack with 2d6 damage will deal
   ```12 + 2d6 + Mod``` damage.
   A guiding bolt spell with 4d6 damage will deal ```24 + 4d6``` damage.

#### 7. Dread
- **Dread.** Some special abilities, circumstances, and events can lead to a special condition called dread. It is measured in seven levels, each more debilitative than the last.
- **Dread Resistance.** Class features and traits that grant immunity to the frightened condition instead grant dread resistance.
- **Frightened.** Spells and other magical effects that would cause the frightened condition instead cause 3 levels of dread.
- **Removing Frightened.** An effect that removes the frightened condition removes 3 levels of dread unless it specifies otherwise, and other spells or effects that soothe emotions or reassure their beneficiaries might reduce dread as well.
- **Dread Duration.** Most sources of dread have a specified duration, at the end of which the level of dread in all affected creatures reduces by 1 level. If an effect doesn’t list a duration, a creature’s dread reduces by 1 level when the creature finishes a long rest.
##### Dread Level Table

| Dread Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1           | **Disturbed**. Must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the dread’s save DC to move closer to the dread’s source.                                                                                                                                 |
| 2           | **Spooked**. Cannot approach the source of the dread (automatically fails the saving throw listed at level 1); disadvantage on ability checks while the dread’s source is within line of sight.                                                        |
| 3           | **Afraid**. Disadvantage on attack rolls while the dread’s source is within line of sight.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 4           | **Staggered**. Drop all held items upon reaching this and any higher level of dread; can’t take bonus actions or reactions; at the start of own turn, must make a Wisdom saving throw against the dread’s save DC; success reduces dread level by one. |
| 5           | **Panicked**. Must take the Dash action and move away from the dread’s source by the safest available route on each turn unless there is nowhere to move.                                                                                              |
| 6           | **Paralyzed**. Paralyzed (see the condition) with fear, either in immediate prior position or cowering.                                                                                                                                                |
| 7           | **Faint**. Fall unconscious from overwhelming shock; must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the dread’s save DC or die; a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check awakens the victim and reduces dread level by one.                     |
##### Dread, Continued
- **Lasting Dread.** When an effect that causes dread ends, the dread it caused might not end immediately. Instead, the dread levels of all creatures affected by that source decrease by one level.
	- The reduced dread’s duration reverts to the longest among all the sources of dread currently applying to the creature, remaining at its new level of dread for the full duration before decreasing again.
- **Dread and the Frightened Condition**. Nonmagical effects that cause the frightened condition (such as a dragon’s Frightful Presence) don’t necessarily cause dread. A creature can be frightened and experiencing dread at the same time without those conditions interacting with each other.
- **Disturbing Discovery.** When a character makes a shocking discovery about the world, realizes that their actions have had horrific results, or is otherwise mentally stressed or traumatized by some terrible revelation, there is a chance that the character experiences dread.
	- **Minor Disturbing Discovery**. A minor disturbing discovery (such as learning that the citizens of the strange town you’re visiting are in fact cannibals, or that the lonely traveler you invited into your home is in fact a vampire) causes one level of dread unless the character succeeds at a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. The dread decreases after 1 hour.
	- **Moderate Disturbing Discovery**. A moderate disturbing discovery (such as learning that the meat pie you ate at the local tavern was made of previous customers or reading a particularly blasphemous and disturbing spellbook) causes two levels of dread unless the character succeeds at a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The dread decreases when the character finishes a long rest.
	- **Major Disturbing Discovery**. A major disturbing discovery (such as realizing that your father was a deep one or that by activating the strange magical artifact in a dungeon you have transformed the entire populace of the city above into zombies) causes three levels of dread unless the character succeeds at a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. The dread decreases after 10 days.
- **No Innate Dread.** Creatures don’t cause dread innately; they generally only cause dread if they would magically frighten a character or drive a character insane.
- **Dread Stack.** Dread from magical fear or from the same creature or kind of creature isn’t cumulative; use only the highest level of dread and longest duration from among these dread conditions.
	- The save DC for this dread is the same as for the spell or magical effect.
	- If the spell or magical effect doesn’t have a save DC, use DC 15 or whatever DC would be most appropriate if one were allowed, such as a save DC equal to 10 + half the source’s challenge rating for a creature or the save DC of a spell scroll of the same rarity for a magic item.
- **Dread Born From Others.** A dread effect caused by supernatural influence lasts as long as the associated insanity or frightened condition would normally last before decreasing.

#### 8. Insanity
- **Insanity.** A long-term condition that has specific effects on a character and their abilities. 
	- Insanity does not in and of itself cause or worsen dread. Rather, insanity functions similar to a disease: it afflicts a character with a specific disadvantage that remains until the insanity is cured or the character recovers from it.
- **Insanity Strength**. All insanities have a save DC that represents its strength.
	- This save DC is equal to the save DC of the source of the insanity.
	- If the source doesn’t have a save DC, use DC 15 or whatever DC would be most appropriate if one were allowed, such as a save DC equal to 10 + half the source’s challenge rating for a creature or the save DC of a spell scroll of the same rarity for a magic item.
   - **Multiple Insanities**. Whenever a character gains a new form of insanity, the save DCs of any existing insanities each increase by 2.
	   - If the new insanity gained is one the victim is already suffering from, use the higher DC between the two + 5 instead of the character having two instances of the insanity.
   - **Recovering from Insanity**. Once every 10 days, a character with an insanity can attempt a Intelligence/Wisdom/Charisma saving throw against the insanity’s DC.
	   - On a success, the insanity’s DC is reduced by 1d4; note that some forms of insanity have effects that trigger if the character fails this save.
	   - As long as the insanity has a DC of at least 1, the character continues to suffer the full effects of the insanity, although it becomes easier to resist its effects and recover as the DC goes down.
	   - Once the insanity reaches a DC of 0, the character is cured and that particular insanity no longer affects them.
   - **Treating Insanity.** Insanity can be treated by ability checks using the Insight or Medicine skill. First, the insanity must be identified.
   - **Identifying Insanity.** A character can identify an insanity with a successful Wisdom (Insight or Medicine) check against the insanity’s save DC.
	   - Then, with 1 hour of effort per day for 10 days, the healer can treat the insanity with a Wisdom (Insight or Medicine) check against the same DC at the end of the week.
	   - If the check succeeds, the patient receives a +2 bonus on their saving throw to reduce the insanity’s save DC for that 10-day period.
   - **Spells.** Greater restoration cures one insanity afflicting a creature.
	   - If a target creature has multiple insanities, the spell only affects the insanity with the lowest DC (chosen by the caster among identified insanities in the case of a tie, or randomly if one isn’t specified).
   - **Sources of Insanity.**
	   - **Catastrophic Mental Trauma.** When a character suffers a reduction of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or gain an insanity related to the cause of the ability score reduction. The DC is equal to 10 + the value of the reduction. If a character’s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score is reduced to 1 or lower, that character automatically develops such an insanity.
	   - **Confusion Effects.** When a character is affected by a confusion spell or another spell or magical effect that causes the character’s actions to be determined randomly, roll d%. On a result less than or equal to the save DC of the spell or effect, the character gains an insanity that persists after the spell or effect ends.

##### Insanity, Continued
- **Delusion.** A character suffering from delusion might believe any number of untrue things.
	- For instance, the character could believe they are suffering from a specific physical condition (such as blindness, deafness, incapacitation, paralysis, etc.).
	- It’s also possible the character is deluded about being blessed with something unrealistically positive, such as divine powers, imperviousness to mundane weapons, or immunity to fire.
	- In any event, upon finishing a long rest, the delusional character must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw against the delusion’s save DC or she experiences the full effects of an imagined physical condition until the end of the next long rest, suffering one detrimental physical condition or a –4 penalty to AC and disadvantage on saving throws against a particular sort of attack falsely believed to be harmless (GM’s discretion).
	- On a success, the delusion has no effect until the end of the next long rest.
- **Dissociation.** These insanities are complex and fairly rare. A character with dissociation has a fractured sense of identity.
	- Most cases of dissociation are forms of amnesia, while the remainder are cases of mental fragmentation.
	- All characters with dissociation have disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws other than saving throws against the dissociation insanity.
- **Total Amnesia.**
- **Personality Fragmentation.** Whenever the character finishes a long rest and each time the character gains a level of dread, a character with personality fragmentation must make a Wisdom saving throw against the personality fragmentation’s save DC.
	- On a failure, a different personality takes over.
	- A character’s memories and skills remain unchanged except that the extra personalities have no knowledge of each other and deny that these other personalities exist, sometimes violently.
	- All extra personalities have disadvantage on Wisdom checks.
- **Erratic Behavior.** A character with erratic behavior seems strange and unreliable.
	- Friends can never predict exactly what the character will do next, and sometimes even the character can’t control these actions.
	- This insanity might manifest as unsettling facial tics or violent spasms.
	- A character with erratic behavior has disadvantage on Charisma checks to interact with anyone unfamiliar with this behavior and can never make a passive Strength or Dexterity check because there is always a chance of unintended movement.
	- Additionally, a character with erratic behavior who enters into a stressful situation such as combat must make a Wisdom saving throw against the erratic behavior’s DC before acting each round.
	- On a failure, the character’s body acts unpredictably, with the GM determining all movement and actions, either at the GM’s discretion or as described in the confusion spell.
- **Hallucinations.** A hallucinating character perceives things that aren’t there.
	- These perceptions can be visual or auditory or might affect the other senses.
	- It is difficult to tell the false perceptions from the real.
	- The character has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks (and thus their passive Perception is reduced by -5).
	- A hallucinating character must make a Wisdom saving throw against the hallucinations’ save DC upon entering a stressful situation (such as combat).
	- On a failure, the character is overwhelmed by a barrage of sensory input, suffering disadvantage on all attack rolls.
	- A hallucinating character can attempt a new Wisdom save at the end of each round to end the effect. The effect ends immediately if the character is killed or knocked unconscious.
	- A character can use an action to counsel the hallucinating character to negate the hallucinations effect with a successful Wisdom (Insight or Medicine) check against the hallucinations’ save DC.
- **Irrational Hatred.** This complex insanity fills the victim with hatred for the world.
	- At the end of each long rest, the character must make a Charisma saving throw against the irrational hatred’s save DC.
	- On a failure, the character’s alignment becomes chaotic evil until the end of the next long rest.
	- While affected by the irrational hatred, the character can’t help but plot and plan the death and destruction of friends and enemies alike.
	- The hateful character is skilled at hiding this hatred, feigning sanity, and resisting treatment; the character always attempts Charisma (Deception) checks when someone tries to diagnose the condition, and gains advantage on this check.
	- For the most part, the impact of irrational hatred must be roleplayed, although not all players find entertainment in roleplaying someone who’s trying to do in their friends.
	- In such cases, the GM should choose another insanity or should plan to use irrational hatred only when the player’s fun won’t be spoiled by giving over control of the character to the GM while the insanity has control.
- **Obsession.** Sometimes referred to as a fixation or mania, the character develops an irrational and troubling obsession with a particular object or situation.
	- A character who gains this insanity often develops an obsession with the source of the insanity.
	- A character with obsession has disadvantage on ability checks when the object of obsession is observable but not in the character’s immediate presence.
	- Additionally, if the character is directly confronted by the obsession or reaches it in some way, the character must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw against the obsession’s DC or become completely enthralled by the target.
	- While enthralled, the character can do nothing but attempt to interact with this object in a manner appropriate to the obsession (such as compulsive reading, fawning over their own appearance, or falling down in worship of a Great Old One).
	- The character still tries to avoid harm, but otherwise remains fixated.
	- The character can make a new saving throw before taking a turn each round; on a success, the character is no longer enthralled and compelled to interact with that target of obsession. 
	- If exposed again, however, the creature must make a yet another saving throw to avoid becoming enthralled again.
- **Paranoia.** A paranoid character is convinced that many distant and nearby creatures, potentially including anyone or everyone, are enemy conspirators.
	- A paranoid character cannot benefit from or use the Help action without succeeding on a Wisdom saving throw against the paranoia’s save DC.
	- A paranoid character has disadvantage on Charisma checks.
	- A paranoid character has a –2 penalty on Wisdom saving throws.
	- A paranoid character cannot willingly accept aid (such as healing or a beneficial spell) from another creature without first suppressing the paranoia, which requires a successful Wisdom saving throw against the paranoia’s DC.
- **Phobia.** A phobia is an irrational fear of some (usually commonplace) object or situation.
	- A character with a phobia automatically gains one level of dread upon observing the feared object or situation.
	- Additionally, if a phobic character is directly confronted by the feared object or situation, the character must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw against the phobia’s DC or gain two additional levels of dread.
	- In either case, the dread is reduced after finishing a short or long rest away from the source of fear.
