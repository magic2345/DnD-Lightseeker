Warped Weave
   Casting spells does not cost spell slots. Instead, they require a successful spellcasting check, one free hand, and any required material components or arcane focus.
   - The level of spells you can cast depends on your class table in the PHB.
   - If your roll does not meet or beat the DC, the spell fails and it cannot be cast again until you complete a long rest.
   - The spellcasting check is:
     d20 + Prof + Spellcasting Mod
     DC = 10 + Spell Level
   - To cast at higher level, simply increase the DC.
   - Rituals can be cast without a spellcasting check.
   - Cantrips can be cast without a spellcasting check. Yet, it also does not become more powerful following the PC's level.
   - Critical Success on the spellcasting check means that the player may choose between: **Double Dice Damage, Double Targets, Double Duration, Recover One Failed Spells.**
   - Critical Fail on the spellcasting check different repercussions depending on the class.
	- Pay Tribute (Cleric, Druids, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Bard)
	   You have angered your deity, offset the balance of nature, or displeased the muses of old. You must pay tribute to regain the ability to cast that spell again.
	   To pay tribute, bring an offering to a place deemed relevant to the source of your magic. For clerics, that might be a temple or shrine to your deity. For druids, that might be a particular grove in the woods or body of water. For bards, that may be a donation to a town crier or raising money for an orphanage by leveraging your art form.

- Blood Magic
  Anytime a PC fails a spellcasting check, they may force the spell to succeed by fueling it with their own blood. To do this, the PC takes 1 blood magic damage for each point needed to allow the spell to be cast successfully. Blood magic can even force a spellcasting check of a natural 1 to succeed.
  A spell cast with blood magic cannot be cast again until you complete a long rest.
- Resurrection Magic
  Any magic that brings a PC back to life.
	- Material components are required.
	- If successfully cast, the target awakens with 1 hit point and can only recover hit points by resting. This effect ends once they reach their maximum hit points.
	- It is absolutely FORBIDDEN to use Blood Magic to cast a Resurrection spell. Or else...
- Paladin's Divine Smite
  Make a spellcasting check according to the what level the slot used is. If the paladin fails, they lose the ability to smite until they finish a long rest.

	- Able to use sorcery points during blood magic.
	- New Metamagic Option:
	  Focused Spell. When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to enhance your focus on the casting. If the spellcasting check fails, you do not lose the spell for that casting unless you rolled a natural 1.

Other than the 6 ability scores, each player has a Madness Score which starts out at 0 and has a max of 10.
   - Each time the player willingly and knowingly does something inhumane (such as killing an innocent), witness a horrifying event, learn a mind-shattering secret/knowledge, or become the target of a madness-inducing effect, they must roll an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw.
   - The DC is equal to 10 + Madness Score.
   - On a success, nothing happens as the player manages to resist the madness.
   - On a failure, the player must roll on the Madness table (Short-Term table for Madness Score of 0-5 and Long-Term table for Madness Score of 6-10). The player's Madness Score also increases by 1. 
   - If a player's Madness Score would go over 10, they succumb to the corruption and become a mindless monster driven by madness.
