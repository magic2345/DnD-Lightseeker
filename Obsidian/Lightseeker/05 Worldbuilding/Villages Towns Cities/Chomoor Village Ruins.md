- **Ruined.** Crumbling stone wall. Remnants of mansions.
- **Morbid Granary.** Tons of wheat have gone bad and spilled onto the ground. Strangely, there are bones of babies inside it.
- **Dog Stench.** The ruined village smells of dog after Rhalgar's Fang razed it into the ground..
- **Desecrated Doghouses.** A sacrificial ritual has been performed near the doghouses, forcibly turning canines into gnolls.
- **Tainted Church.** The church is dedicated to Taarun, goddess of sun and luck. Its priests and followers have been killed by Priest Uerna, who had now become a lamia after making a pact with Marielle. A strange ornate mirror stands at the center of the building, surrounded by corpses.
