- Ruins of a shrine dedicated to an ancient goddess of sun and luck, now partly buried underground.
- Now, a lamia makes its lair here, where she keeps prisoners to entertain itself.
- She orders jackalweres to go out and enslave people.

- Lamias are especially predisposed to toying with people who are beautiful or handsome. As for the ugly ones, they are served as food and eaten.
- It is working adjacent to [[Rhalgar's Fang]] but not necessarily on good terms.
- Many of her prisoners come from nearby villages, especially the now-destroyed [[Chomoor Village Ruins|Chomoor Village]].

- Lamias believe that eating the eyeballs of beautiful people will make it more beautiful.
- Lamias love collecting beautiful objects, especially gems.

Possible Enemies:
- CR0 [[Jackal]].
- CR1/2 [[Jackalwere]], minions of Uerna. Originally canines.
- CR2 [[Ankheg]], Azul, Uerna's pet. Often feeds on the prisoners.
- CR4 [[Lamia]], Uerna, once a high priest, blessed to become what she is now. She has been driven insane by the lack of connection to her goddess.
