[[Key|Coordinates: -1,-2]]

- A semi-broken gate to the Feywild. Creatures can pass through and arrive here, but not the opposite.
- A manticore made its lair here, feasting on the fae that has just crossed over.
	- The manticore escaped from [[Immindell's Lab]].
	- Giant parts are mixed in.

Possible Enemies:
- CR3 [[Manticore]], the result of a sick experiment to combine beasts with giants.
- CR1/4 [[Pixie]], crossed over due to curiosity. They are able to become invisible at will. They are shy tricksters.
