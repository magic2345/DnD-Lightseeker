[[Key|Coordinates: -1,-2]]

- A semi-broken gate to the Feywild. Creatures can pass through and arrive here, but not the opposite.
- A manticore made its lair here, feasting on the fae that has just crossed over.

Possible Enemies:
- CR3 [[Manticore]], the result of a failed ritual to revive a long lost pet.
- CR1/4 [[Pixie]], crossed over due to curiosity. They are able to become invisible at will. They are shy tricksters.
