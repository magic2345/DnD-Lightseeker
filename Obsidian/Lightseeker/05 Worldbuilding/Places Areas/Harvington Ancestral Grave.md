- A graveyard in the middle of the forest.
- The graves seem to occasionally tremble, as if the corpses inside are trying to break out.
- The wraith of Varyan Harvington made its lair here. A war general of the [[Harvington House]] tasked to protect the northeastern border of [[Vanblume]].
- The truth is that Varyan deserted the army for riches and personal gain.
- As a wraith, he commands specters of the Harvington House members to raid nearby areas for silver and gold.
