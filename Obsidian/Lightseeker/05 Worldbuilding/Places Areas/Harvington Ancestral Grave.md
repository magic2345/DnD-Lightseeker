- A graveyard in the middle of the forest.
- The graves seem to occasionally tremble, as if the corpses inside are trying to break out.
- The wraith of Varyan Harvington made its lair here. A war general of the [[Harvington House]] tasked to protect the northeastern border of [[Vanblume]].
- The truth is that Varyan deserted the army for riches and personal gain. He and his family were then executed through various torture methods.
- As a wraith, he commands specters of the Harvington House members to raid nearby areas for silver and gold.

Possible Enemies:
- CR1/2 [[Warhorse Skeleton]], used to be a part of the Harvington knights.
- CR1 [[Boneless]], those who die by having their bones crushed, etc.
- CR1 [[Specter]], bound to Varyan Harvington.
- CR2 [[Undying Soldier]], knights loyal to the Harvington family, their loyalty protecting them against the divine.
- CR5 [[Wraith]], Varyan Harvington, the traitor.
