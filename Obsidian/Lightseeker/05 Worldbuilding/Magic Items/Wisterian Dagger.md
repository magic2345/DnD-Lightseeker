A dagger capable of sealing the power of beings with elemental blood. It is made out of Gorgon horns submerged in Wyvern Poison for 3 days, letting the poison be absorbed into the horns.

When used to wound an elemental, they must make a DC20 Constitution saving throw each turn until the dagger is pulled out. If they fail, they are poisoned for 4 hours and take 3d10 poison damage each turn. If they succeed, they are not poisoned and only take half damage.

Dying this way, the elemental will turn into stone.
