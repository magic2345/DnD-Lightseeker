- Brigganocks are small good-natured mouse-like fey who collect wish stones.
- Sometimes, when a child makes a wish, that wish will enter a stone, which would then become a wish stone. These stones are then traded with others for food and other supplies.
- Brigganocks' souls float outside their body and shed light.
