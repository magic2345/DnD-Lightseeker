Ironwood is a magical substance created from normal wood by druids. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, ironwood is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel.

Spells and effects that affect metal do not affect ironwood, whereas spells that affect wood doâ€”although ironwood will not burn.
