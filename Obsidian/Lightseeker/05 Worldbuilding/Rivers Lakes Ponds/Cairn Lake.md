- Located northwest of [[Maplemoor Town]], next to [[Oakweller Village]].
- There is a pillar of red light coming from the center of the lake that reaches high into the clouds.

Points of Interest:
- **Strange Red Light.** At the center of the misty lake, a beam of red light pierces straight into the sky.
- **Roiling Waters.** At times, the water in the lake roils as if hit by a hurricane. This results in severe flooding of the area.
