(Devi, Edwin, Ien, Mark)
## Spring 4
#### Chomoor in Ruins
- Priest Garmund's family are all dead, except for his son, Garmund Jr.
- Chayan used magic to locate Garmund Jr.
- Fergus is reminded of a strange peculiarity during the gnoll raid on Maplemoor.
	- The gnolls were focused on taking corpses instead of valuables.
- Xana went to scour the studies of the ruined mansions and found letters between the noble and a spy they've planted in Maplemoor.
	- The church of Minareth had a disagreement with the Maplemoor higher ups.
- Kris had a conversation with Priest Garmund.
	- He told Kris of a troubling conversation he had overheard in the church. A few priests are taking bribes from noblemen.
	- Priest Garmund is planning to leave the church after this is all over.

## Spring 5

#### Buried Temple to a Sun God
- The party located Garmund Jr. to be inside the buried temple.
- The master of the Jackalweres, Uerna, has captured slaves.
- Most of the slaves are locked in a metal cage, while others serve as cooks and dancers.
	- Master Uerna likes beauty in general.
- The party raided the buried temple, releasing the captives and fighting Uerna herself.
	- Uerna's body is that of a beautiful woman mixed with a cow's body. (Imagine centaurs but with a cow instead)
	- Uerna seemed infatuated with Fergus' patron, C'tar. Using that as a distraction, the party escaped with the slaves.
- The party quickly rushed back to Maplemoor, saving only the child slaves.
	- The rest of the slaves were unfortunately cut down during the chase.

#### Aftermath
- The child slaves are taken care of by the church's nuns.
- Priest Garmund thanks the party and gives them several rewards.
	- 500gp
	- **Hunter Orb.** An orb with lines and patterns on it. The priest received it from a good hunter friend who had passed away. It seems to be an important artifact for hunters.
