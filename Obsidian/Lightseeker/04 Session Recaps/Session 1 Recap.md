(Abiyyu, Devi, Edwin, Mark)

##### Dank Cave
- Drank the hunter concoction
- Thrown into a well. A trial from Andurin
- Met Rucks, a hunter ghost
- Found corpse of Lydia in an underwater passage. A female elf guard who was strangled to death by a person wearing metal nails.
- Fought Ankheg Broodlings
##### Chasm and Vines
- Persuaded Rucks to help show the way out by promising for him to go to heaven
- Snuck past the "giant mosquito" nest
- Found a way out, but the players would need to jump across a chasm and climb upwards on vines
- Failed to climb, rope broke
- Found a small town (?) of tiny rodent miners with bulbs of lights outside of them
- Discovered that cattle often falls down into the chasm
- Found that the vines below are alive and are carnivorous
##### Ankheg Nest
- Found an area where sunlight passes through tree roots and into the cave. A few animals live in the vegetation that grew there
- Obliterated a lone Ankheg Broodling
- Found Ankheg nest with lots of eggs
- A large creature is approaching from the Ankheg tunnel
