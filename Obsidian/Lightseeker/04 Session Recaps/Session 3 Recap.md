## Spring 2
#### Strange Invitation
- The journey begins.
- Travelling was mostly peaceful.
- At night, the party was visited by a pair of Jackalweres who invited them to meet Master Uerna.
	- Fergus has heard of her name, a priest of Chomoor who was somewhat famous.
- The pair told the party that Chomoor had been laid to waste by the gnoll warband.
- Although the party has tried to be cordial, the situation escalated into a fight as the Jackalweres resorted to violence to bring the party over to their master.
## Spring 3
#### World of Ash
- The once green scenery turns into one of grey and black.
- Remnants of a forest fire fills most of the party's surroundings.
- At night, the party decided that Kris will scout ahead to Chomoor.
	- Ruins are what's left of the village.
	- Through divine sense, Kris found several spots of desecration. They were near doghouses, with blood all over the ground.
	- Kris decided to wait for the party to come at dawn and slept on a tree.
- Meanwhile, back at the makeshift camp, a band of gnolls fell upon the party.
	- Although the party successfully lowered their morale enough for them to flee, the horse pulling the wagon was hurt by a gnoll and fled the area, Priest Garmund hidden in the wagon.
	- Chayan memorized the direction of where the gnolls fled to.

Next Up:
- Party is rushing after the bleeding horse and wagon.
